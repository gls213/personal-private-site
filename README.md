# personal-private-site

Hello, I would like for a site that is developing to have a password protected directory. I have made many attempts to create an .htaccess file while following tutorials, how tos and member forums, all with the same failed result. Usually a "500 internal server error". More details are in the specific issues tab. 

The second part is a jquary slider that is repeated in the markup. The second slider looses functionality. When a user clicks on a thumbnail they are taken to the top of the page instead of into the slideshow. More details in the issues tab.
